This would require writing explicit loops or creating temporary copies of data, both of which are inefficient.\n","\n","2. **Code Readability**: Imagine having to write nested loops every time you want to add a scalar to each element in a matrix, or add corresponding elements of arrays with different dimensions. Your code would become cluttered and harder to understand.\n","\n","3. **Memory Optimization**: Broadcasting allows operations without actually duplicating the data in memory.
